# p3p_AS_PSC_SS_CCNA
This will be a collection of all sorts of configurations I use for personal projects as well as lab projects in my journey for my AS in CyberSecurity. I will have my CCNA router and switches, and other files with source code for other languages I'll be learning as I'm doing this. Thanks for checking it out!
